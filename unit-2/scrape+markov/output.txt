Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Mince garlic. Trim, then thinly slice scallions, keeping greens and whites separate. Finely mince chili, removing seeds and ribs for less heat. Halve tomatoes. Cut lemon into wedges. Rinse shrimp and pat dry with a paper towel.2Heat a drizzle of olive oil in large pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic, scallion whites, and chili (to taste). Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shrimp and cook, tossing, until starting to turn pink but not quite cooked through, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.3Once water is boiling, add tagliatelle to pot. (TIP: If any noodles are stuck together, separate them first.) Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 4-5 minutes. Carefully scoop out and reserve ¼ cup pasta cooking water, then drain.4Meanwhile, add tomatoes to pan with shrimp. Cook, tossing, until wilted and juicy, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside until pasta is ready. TIP: If you like it extra hot, add any remaining chili (to taste) at this point.5Once tagliatelle is done cooking, return pan with shrimp and tomatoes to medium heat and add tagliatelle and 2 TBSP butter. Toss to combine and melt butter. Season with salt and pepper.6Remove pan from heat and stir in sour cream, a squeeze of lemon, and as much pasta cooking water as needed to reach a saucy consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Divide between plates or bowls and garnish with scallion greens. Serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over.Explore Similar RecipesTagliatelle RecipesShrimp RecipesYou also might be interested inMeal KitsMeal Kit GuideMeal Planning GuideMeal Prepping GuideNewsroomRecipe DirectoryTop HelloFresh RecipesQuick MealsMexican RecipesItalian RecipesPasta RecipesMexican Taco RecipesOrder Food OnlineNYC Food DeliverySan Francisco Food DeliveryMeal Kits for SinglesMeal Kits for Two or CouplesMeal Kits for New ParentsKid Friendly Meal KitsQuick & Easy Meal KitsCooking Subscription BoxIngredient Delivery ServiceGrocery Delivery ServiceMeal Prep Delivery ServiceMeal Delivery ServiceVegetarian Meal Kit Delivery ServicePescatarian Meal Delivery ServiceFlexitarian Meal Plan Delivery ServiceHealthy Meal Delivery ServiceLow Carb Meal Delivery ServiceLow Calorie Meal Delivery ServiceLunch Meal KitsCheap Meal KitsEasy recipesRecipe Subscription BoxMeal Subscription BoxFood Subscription BoxHome Cooked MealsHome Delivery MealsFood Delivery BoxMeal Box Delivery ServiceDinner Delivery ServiceHelloFresh Coupon CodesIs HelloFresh Worth It?The Internet's Best Meal Kit Delivery ServiceGourmet Meal Kit Delivery ServiceMeal Delivery for SeniorsYou also might be interested inHelloFreshStudentsBlogRecipesHero DiscountsRecipe DirectoryCalifornia Supply Chains ActDelivery OptionsOur companyHelloFresh GroupSustainabilityCareersPressWork with usPartnerInfluencersAffiliatesContact usHelp Center & FAQPartnership InquiriesCorporate SalesDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationPayment methodsHelloFreshOur companyWork with usContact usPayment methods© HelloFresh 2024Terms and ConditionsPrivacyAccessibilityfacebooktwitterinstagram
