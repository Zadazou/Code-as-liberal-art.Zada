Salmorejo Cordobés is a cold tomato soup from the Andalusian region of Spain. It's a smoother, more luscious version of its Andalusian cousin, gazpacho, and is served with toppings like hard-boiled egg, jamón, and olive oily tuna, giving it an extra touch of texture and sustenance. Back when I lived in Madrid, my roommate from Sevilla showed me how to make salmorejo, and ever since, it's been one of my summer staples. In fact, I'll be serving it by the (biodegradable) cupful at Joan y Cati, my husband and my new sandwich shop & takeaway eatery in Mallorca, España. As you can imagine, I've been doing a lot of recipe testing lately and that means daily trips to the market. A pro tip I recently learned from one of the vendors: "pear" tomatoes are the best for making salmorejo. But above all, choose whichever tomatoes are at their peak ripeness.  When I'm not preparing it myself, my favorite salmorejo spot is Bar Alfalfa in Sevilla. There you can order it the classic way: in a bowl, topped with the traditional "taquitos" of jamón, chopped HB egg and a drizzle of good, Andalusian olive oil. Or, you can order their Brusquetta Andaluza—a thick toast or "pan de pueblo," with a generous spread of salmorejo, fresh mozzarella cheese, and chopped jamón—essentially a dressed down bread bowl. Either vessel does the trick. Que aproveche!  —Caitlin Gunther See what other Food52ers are saying. Our best tips for eating thoughtfully and living joyfully, right in your inbox.
