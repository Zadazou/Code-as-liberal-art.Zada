1/2 cup

3 cups

ice For the onion masala with English peas: 
Place a large saut√© pan over moderate heat and add the canola oil. 
 
Add the mustard seeds and cook until they pop like popcorn. 
 
Add the onions and continue to cook over moderate heat until they cook down and start to caramelize.

 
Add the ginger and garlic to the pan, cooking for about 4 minutes.
 
Ad the cumin, cayenne, and turmeric and cook for 2 minutes. Then, add the tomatoes and cook until the entire mixture thickens. Season with salt, to taste. (This mixture can be pre-made and kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.)
 
Stir in the English peas and fresh chilies, combining until they heat up in the mixture.
 
Finally, stir in the homemade paneer, mint, and cilantro. Mix well and season with salt, to taste. Serve with crusty bread.
 For the homemade paneer: 
In a large pan, slow bring the milk to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once the milk is boiling, stir in the salt.
 
Add the lime juice gradually, gently stirring to curdle the milk. Once the curd separates, let cook for 1 minute.
 
Shock the mixture with ice, then drain into a single layer of cheese cloth. The paneer should be soft, moist, and creamy.  (For firmer paneer: Drain it for longer. For solid paneer: Place it into a muslin cloth and into a paneer mold; press it with a lid and put a water-filled jar or bowl on top to apply pressure; remove the paneer from the mold after 1-2 hours.)
 
If you don't plan on using the paneer right away, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
