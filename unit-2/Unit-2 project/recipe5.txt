Every time a guest enters one of my restaurants, I want them to feel as though they are coming into an Indian home. I want them to enjoy the vibrant flavors, spices, and fresh ingredients, my friends and I grew up eating. This stir fry of soft paneer and peas, with a masala (which basically just means "mix") of tomatoes, onion, ginger, garlic, and spices, incorporates all of those elements. The trick for me is to get the paneer (I make it home made using organic milk) soft and creamy, so that it folds in with the other elements—fresh-cut chilies, blanched English peas, and herbs—of the dish. I like to serve it with a slice of bread or piece of a baguette, but you can also eat it with a roti, naan, or pita bread.  —Floyd Cardoz See what other Food52ers are saying.
