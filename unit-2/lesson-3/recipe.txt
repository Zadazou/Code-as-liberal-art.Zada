I learned how to make this when I dated a Belizean man for about a year. He is long gone, but I still make his stew and I love it! This is a very healthy dish but the limes and the hot sauce make it very flavorful. Serve with corn or flour tortillas. Each person may want to spice it up with more hot sauce as they prefer. 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves   seasoned salt to taste 6 cups chicken broth 1 head green cabbage, shredded 1 large onion, chopped 1 cup chopped carrots 1  green bell pepper, chopped 2 stalks celery, chopped Â½ cup chopped cilantro 1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce 2  limes, juiced 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 dash hot sauce (such as Marie Sharp's Belizean Habanero Sauce), or to taste   salt and ground black pepper to taste  Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Season chicken with seasoned salt. Cook chicken in the hot oil until browned on the outside, about 5 minutes per side.
  Mix chicken broth, cabbage, onion, carrots, green bell pepper, celery, cilantro, tomato sauce, lime juice, garlic, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper into chicken and simmer, adding water if needed, until stew is thickened, about 2 hours.
  Ladle stew into bowls and top each with a piece of chicken.
  If you use bone-in chicken breast, cut them in half or thirds with bone-in.
